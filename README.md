## 🚀 About Me

Hi! I'm Ken — a Computer Science student with a deep passion for **Machine Learning**, **Artificial Intelligence**, and building systems that can *actually make a difference*. I began exploring **Data Science** in 2024 and quickly transitioned into **Machine Learning Engineering** after realizing I wanted to build real-world, end-to-end systems — not just Jupyter notebooks.

My long-term mission? To master the full stack of ML — from models to MLOps — and build intelligent systems that help solve **real human problems**. Right now, I’m focused on creating practical, production-level ML projects and learning how AI agents and large models can be used responsibly and effectively.

## 🧠 What I’m Learning

- 🔧 **Machine Learning Engineering** (modular ML systems, pipelines)
- 🧱 **MLOps** (experiment tracking, CI/CD for ML, deployment)
- 🤝 **Agentic AI** (multi-agent systems, legal-AI prototypes)
- 🧾 **Natural Language Processing** (classification, prompt engineering)
- 💸 **Fintech ML** (risk scoring, multi-task models)
