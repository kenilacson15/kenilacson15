## 🚀 About Me

Hi! I'm Ken — a Computer Science student with a mission to build intelligent, responsible, and scalable ML systems. My journey started with data science in 2024, but I quickly found my drive in building **end-to-end machine learning solutions** that go beyond notebooks and into real-world systems.

My core interests lie in **Reinforcement Learning**, **Natural Language Processing**, and **MLOps** — especially how agents and language models can solve high-impact problems. I’m currently focused on transforming ideas into **production-ready ML pipelines** and studying how large AI systems can be made more effective, ethical, and robust.

## 🧠 What I’m Learning

- 🧠 **Reinforcement Learning** (agent behavior, policy optimization, multi-agent systems)
- 🔡 **Natural Language Processing** (LLMs, prompt engineering, transformers)
- 🧱 **MLOps** (CI/CD for ML, experiment tracking, model monitoring)
- 🔧 **ML Engineering** (modular pipelines, scalable architectures)
- 💸 **Fintech ML** (credit scoring, multi-task modeling)
- 🤖 **Agentic AI** (reasoning agents, Tree of Thoughts, LangChain)
